# social-go

The backend of a "social network" made with Golang. The project was taken intially from: [medium](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/crud-restful-api-with-go-gorm-jwt-postgres-mysql-and-testing-460a85ab7121).

## Part 1

The part 1 was building the code itself and making it work. Already integrated with golint, goformat and another language specific plugins provided in VSCode.

The next step is adding **tests**, which is close.

Until now, Go as proved itself a good and nice structured language. From a JS developer point of view, it's very different from my mother language, but it made me go out of my comfort zone and really learn it. Even if I'm still on the beggining, I'll improve this project as long as it's made possible!
