The backend of a "social network" made with Golang. The project was taken intially from: [medium](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/crud-restful-api-with-go-gorm-jwt-postgres-mysql-and-testing-460a85ab7121).

The part 1 was building the code itself and making it work. Already integrated with golint, goformat and another language specific plugins provided in VSCode.

The next step is adding **tests**, which is close.
